# GoblinSlayer
A computer game where users can explore a world, fight goblins and complete challenges.

### Running Application 
In order to run this project on your computer you can clone this repo then run the game on unity 

### Game overview 

Users will have a player that has a variety of movement options (run forward, run backward, walk forward and jump). This player also has a variety of combat options (swinging sword and kicking).

Player will be dropped in a world where goblins are attacking the player. When the goblin makes contact with the player the player health will decrease. Player must use one of the combat options to attack goblin and defeat goblin. Once the player has defeated all goblins player must find the castle and unlock the castle door to access the next round.
